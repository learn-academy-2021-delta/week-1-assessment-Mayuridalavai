// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding practical questions

// To run file: navigate to the correct directory in terminal, $ node code-challenges.js

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// --------------------1) Create a statement that determines if a temperature is below boiling point, at boiling point, or above boiling point. Boiling point is 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

// Create the code and test each of the variables provided. Expected output: "35 is below boiling point", "350 is above boiling point", "212 is at boiling point"
//here we have 3 varables. In this code I used 'if', 'elseif' and 'else' commands to know the boiling point temperature 
//and console.log is used to print the data 

//var temp = 35
 //var temp = 350
 //var temp= 212
//if(temp===35){
    //console.log("35 is below boiling point")
//}
//else if(temp===350){
    //console.log("350 is above boiling point")
//}
//else{console.log("212 is at boiling point")}

// --------------------2) Create the code that will combine two arrays and return the length using the variables provided below. Expected output: 10

//In This code I'm using concat command which is used to merge 2 or more arrays to form one combined array and console.log is used to print the output

var myNumbers1 = [3, 7, 0, 36, -9]
var myNumbers2 = [8, -7, 22, 9, 13]

//console.log(myNumbers1.concat(myNumbers2))


// --------------------3) Create the code that will reverse the letters of a string using the test variables provided below. Expected output: "eilrahc", "atled"

var myString1 = "charlie"
var myString2 = "delta"


console.log(charlie.reverse())


console.log(delta.reverse())



// --------------------4) Create a statement that evaluates two numbers and subtracts the smaller number from the larger number using the two sets of test variables provided below. Expected output: 15, 12
// In this code two variables are subtracted and - sign is used for subtraction and console.log is used to print the output 
var number1 = 42
var number2 = 27

// var number1 = 7
// var number2 = 19

//console.log(42-27)
//console.log(19-7)

// --------------------5) Copy/paste your code from #4. Refactor your code to also accept non-number edge cases. Inform your user if the variable is not a number using the two sets of test variables provided below. Expected output: "Your input is not a number", 3
//In this code I used console.log cose to print the output and - sign use to subtract two variables
//var numberRefactor1 = 42
//var numberRefactor2 = "hello"

var numberRefactor1 = 27
var numberRefactor2 = 24

//console.log("Your input is not a variable")
//console.log(27-24)
