# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a command used in the terminal. github is global information tracker and it is a website we can save, change  and manage the data or program by many users  

  Researched answer: Git is a free, open-sourced version control system widely used in the programming world. It is a very powerful tool used for sharing and working on code and allows for many people to contribute to the same code base. Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to track changes in source code. Git is accessed primarily through the command line.





2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: relational operators

  Researched answer: Reasearched in syllabus Relational operators looks for a relationship between two values. A Boolean value is returned.
  2 > 0= output==> true



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the value of the string. index is a number and value may be word, number or sentence

  Researched answer:  Index: Every value in an array has a particular location know as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element.
  Value: Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value.







4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: paranthesis and dot operation are the  built-in method

  Researched answer: Javascript has many builtin methods. a builtin methods is a small piece of functionality that has been added to the language to accomplish a commom task since arrays are  great way to store data it makes sense that there are alot of built-in methods that act on array to help us toaccess and modify the contents. the additional information is passed in to parantheses that follow the built-in method which is called arguments.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair Programming means working two people as a team. 
  In pair progamming one should be a navigator and  another should be a driver. 
  communicate each other
  understand each other. 
  help each other. 
  Have Patience each other.


  Researched answer: 1.Ping Pong technique:this form of pairing is performed in conjuction with teat-driven development. one person write the test and another person makes the test pass.
  2.Driver-Navigator: It is little bit like two people driving in a rally car race, with one person driving or writing othe person navigating
  3.Unstructured pairing: It is free flowing with turn talking between driver and Navigator occuring as and when it makes sense
  




6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: pair programming  



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: 
Functions are powerful tools that can take any kind of data as an input. Often we need a function to interact with data sets and perform iterations. This section integrates functions, loops, and arrays to create reusable, iterative code machines.



2. Higher Order Functions: 
 Higher-order functions are build in methods in javascript that act on array. they are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument.



3. Jest: 
Jest is a javascripts testing framework. The Framework is a collection of files that are managed by yarn a technology created by facebook to manage dependency files.


4. Objects: 
 Object class represents one of javascript's datatype. It is used to store various keyed collection and complex entities.

5. Classes:
Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior, classes are the blueprints of objects, just like functions, classes have their ownn space
